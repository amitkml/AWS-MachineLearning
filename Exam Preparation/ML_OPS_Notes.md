# Machine Learning in Production

## ML OPS

Prediction server can be hosted into

- Cloud
- Edge

**Deployment can be subjected to**

- concept drift/data drift (Lets say lighting condition at the factory where deployment there is different and hence now model is not able to detect.)

## Steps of a ML Project

### Case study: speech recognition

Now, we need to think about data for the project. **One of the problem with data is that, consistency of data labelling**.
